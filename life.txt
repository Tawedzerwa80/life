LIFE

Since Formation, it was so Incredible and Adorable
Vibrant, Colourful and full of Promises
Flourishing full of Good Aroma
Such is Life.

Then, I started to grow up, "Wellcome Boy, Welcome"
To the real taste of Life,
Fill and Taste it yourself,
How does it Fill?
Such is Life.

Is is Adorabe as you think?
Is it that easy, and full of the sweet Aroma,
Oooo, know full of Surprises, Agony and hassels,
Such is life.

But, This is not the end of it, but jus the begining,
Brave it, Storm it it needs you, and you only,
Thats how they did it the great grey hairs and the white heads,
such is life.

With all the blooms, and the Blossoms, it brings,
With all the adours, and the gnashing, it brings along,
You just have to brave it,
Such is life.
